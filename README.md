Node.js Othello web application
===============================
This is developed for my short-term learning Node.js and websocket.

Description
-----------
Very simple internet-Othello-battle application.
I tried to solve this problem by functional style programming as possible, but that was not easy.
Programs in "othello.js" is completely functional. This is brain of Ohtello-game program.
But, some parts of server side and client side IO program are bit complicated.

Usage
-----
At first, install Node.js and it's npm library "socket.io", "ejs".
And you can start this application as follows.

    $ node app.js

Soon web server starts up and you can use this application by accessing http://localhost:8080/ through browser.
...and, let's play Othello!!
